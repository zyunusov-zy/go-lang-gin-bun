 Ultimate Prompt: Full E-commerce Backend with Go
Objective:
Build a production-grade monolithic e-commerce backend in Go using:

🔧 Gin (HTTP router & controllers)

🗄️ Bun ORM with PostgreSQL (DB & models)

🔐 JWT for secure authentication and role-based access

💬 Gorilla WebSocket for real-time consumer ↔ seller chat

💼 Full structure: controllers, services, repositories, models, routes, middlewares, utils

🎯 Features
Authentication
JWT-based login/register

Password hashing (bcrypt)

Role-based middleware ("seller" or "consumer")

Item Management (only seller)
Seller can create/update/delete items

Consumer can list/view items

Shopping (consumer side)
Add to cart

Create orders

View orders

Real-time Chat (WebSocket)
Consumer sends message to seller

Seller can respond

WebSocket room/channel per user

Bonus
Graceful project structure (service interface + controller separation)

Clean Bun models with migrations

Production-ready middleware (error handling, auth)

Pagination, search filters, input validation

🧠 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan (How I’ll Teach You)
Phase	Focus	Concepts You'll Learn
1️⃣	Init Project	Gin setup, clean file structure, Go modules
2️⃣	DB Connection	Bun setup, PostgreSQL config, env management
3️⃣	Auth (JWT)	Secure login/register with services/controllers
4️⃣	Middleware	Auth middleware, role-based access
5️⃣	Models + Migrations	Bun ORM for User, Item, Order, Message, Cart
6️⃣	Services/Repositories	Dependency injection, clean logic separation
7️⃣	Items	Seller-only item CRUD
8️⃣	Cart + Orders	Consumer add to cart, checkout
9️⃣	WebSocket Chat	WebSocket rooms, Goroutine handling
🔟	Final Polish	Pagination, graceful errors, test endpoints




🔨 Modules Breakdown
✅ 1. User Module ✅ (Already done)
Auth with JWT

Register/Login

Roles (seller/consumer)

Middleware

🛒 2. Item Module (Next Step)
Seller uploads items/products (POST /items/upload)

Consumer views list of items (GET /items)

Clean architecture: controller → service (interface) → repository → DB (Bun)

💰 3. Order Module
Consumer buys an item (POST /orders)

Fetch consumer's orders (GET /orders)

Mark order as completed/delivered (for seller)

💬 4. Chat Module (WebSocket with Gorilla)
One-to-one real-time chat between seller and consumer

Only starts when consumer views item or makes purchase

Save messages to DB

⚙️ 5. Admin Tools (Optional Later)
Basic dashboard to see all users/items/orders (admin role)
